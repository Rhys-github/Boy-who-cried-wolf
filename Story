**Story**

*Introduction*
A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. 
All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. 
One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, 
he thought of a plan to amuse himself.

*Part II - Plot*
His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. 
So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the 
top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"
